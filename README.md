# Nuclei Templates for OWASP Testing: Automating Web Security Scans


Introduction
Web applications are a common target for attackers, making security testing critical. OWASP has been a leading authority in web application security, providing a list of the most common and dangerous vulnerabilities. Nuclei, a powerful tool in the security tester's arsenal, allows automated scanning using pre-built or custom templates. This article explores how to use Nuclei templates for OWASP testing, providing actionable examples.

What is Nuclei?
Nuclei is an open-source vulnerability scanning tool designed to run customizable templates. It enables security researchers to scan for known vulnerabilities and misconfigurations with great speed and precision. Nuclei supports YAML-based templates, which define the vulnerabilities or misconfigurations to be detected. Templates can be tailored to specific use cases like OWASP's top 10 vulnerabilities.

Understanding OWASP Top 10
The OWASP Top 10 is a regularly updated list of the top security risks facing web applications. The current list includes:

1. **Broken Access Control**
2. **Cryptographic Failures**
3. **Injection**
4. **Insecure Design**
5. **Security Misconfiguration**
6. **Vulnerable and Outdated Components**
7. **Identification and Authentication Failures**
8. **Software and Data Integrity Failures**
9. **Security Logging and Monitoring Failures**
10. **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)**
